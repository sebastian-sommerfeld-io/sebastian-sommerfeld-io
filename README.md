I started my career as a Java full-stack software engineer, building frontends, backends, and everything in between. Over time, my focus shifted toward infrastructure, automation, and developer enablement-evolving into a platform engineer working in a Kubernetes-based GitOps environment.

I'm passionate about Infrastructure as Codeâ€”and really, *everything as code*. From bootstrapping developer machines to deploying production-grade workloads, I believe in defining systems declaratively and managing them through version control.

Most of the repositories here are forks or smaller experiments. My main projects and more structured work live in the [sommerfeld.io organization](https://github.com/sommerfeld-io). If you're into GitOps, Kubernetes, automation, or developer tooling, feel free to check it out!

Feel free to contact me at <sebastian@sommerfeld.io>.
